# Introduction

Welcome to the Titan Colleague Portal Management App. In this app you can add/edit/delete colleagues to your databases, assign that colleague within a specific department, and add/edit/delete that colleagues personal data with the ability to find their personal data quickly. 

In many business today, and many I have worked in, personal details and information are still kept in a huge folder somewhere in an office, and to find this data in a huge pile of paper is not efficient, or secure, especially when your trying to find cover quickly for your business. Which is why this app has been developed to solve real world issues, for companies with large colleague numbers to deal with issues and problems more efficiently. This app allows companies to upload their colleagues information relating to their job role, which department they work in, including personal information such as contact numbers, all within a secure app at only lets the authorised users effect any changes.
